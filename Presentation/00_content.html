template: plain
name: online_reference
header: ## On this Training

Following some general informations in this training:._[]

* [Prevailing C++-Implementations	](#prevailing_implementations)
* [Structure of the Training Document	](#training_document)
* [Online-Version			](#online_version)
* [Info-Graphics			](#info_graphics)
* [Training in English Language		](#english_language)
* [Private Annotations			](#private_annotations)

.F[:
The Online Version contains many "clickable" Links. These are distinguished only
unobtrusively so that they not disturb the flow of reading. When viewing this
document in a browser, the links reveal themselves more explicitly when hovering
with the mouse cursor.
]

---
template: plain
name: prevailing_implementations
header: ### Prevailing C++-Implementations

Most recent compilers implement C++11._[] to a moderate or even complete degree.

.N.center[
Therefore the C++11 Standard has been the guideline for what is contained and
how is it represented in that Training.
]

Occasionally

* Parts of C++98 and C++03, that are out-of-date and deprecated are accordingly
  marked, and

* important additions of C++14 or C++1y are mentioned as **future** extensions.

.F[:
Exactly spelled that standard is: ISO/ICE-14882:2011(E). The official document
may be bought from the ISO Institute, but the copyright for personal copy makes
it illegal to distribute it, so it cannot be contained here.
]

---

template: plain
name: training_document
header: ### Training Documents

In consideration of the extent of the ISO-Standard(s) for C++._[] this
presentation by far cannot cover that topic exhaustively – even at a strongly
reduced scope.

.F[:
The official document for the C++11 standard (ISO/IEC 14882:2011(E)) has more
that 1300 pages!
]

The documentation for this training consists of

* [Presentation Pages](#presentation_pages)
  (including [Footnotes](#presentation_footnotes)),
* [Example Code](#code_examples) (in various forms) and
* external Links to [Extended Information](#external_links).

These elements have a different purpose.

.N.center[
Especially with respect to Standard Library Classes and Functions you have to
use additional [Online References](#online_references).
]

A presentation alone can never be sufficient in this respect and does not strive
to.

---
template: plain
name: online_references
header: #### Online References

[C++98]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++98#Standardization
[C++03]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B03
[C++11]: https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp11
[C++14]: https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/cpp14
[C++1z]: https://isocpp.org/std/status

If you use an IDE with an integrated help feature showing reference information
for standard classes and functions, go and use it!

But also be aware that integrated help feature for a specific environment might
not make a clean separation between
  
* Language and Library Features according to some C++ standard, and

* Extensions specific for some Implementation.

Independent Online References as now available in the Internet do not have that
problem, e.g.

* http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/
* http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/

.I[
Information presented there documents C++ according to ths ISO/ANSI Standard,
clearly marking changes of the 2011 ([C++11]), 2014 ([C++14]) and (expected for)
2017 ([C++1z]) releases.

template: plain
name: presentation_pages
header: #### Presentation Pages

The main purpose of the presentation is

* to serve as a guiding thread through the topics covered,

* demonstrating typical use with code fragments,

* warn about errors, misuse, and pitfalls,

* if necessary or useful adding "behind the scenes" information.

.N.center[
**At any time**, your questions are welcome!._[]

Also, if you are about to pose a question, please do not feel limited by the
content of the current presentation page.
]

.F[:
The option to ask question is one of the major advantanges to visit a training
compared to reading a book – so use it!
]

---
template: plain
name: presentation_footnotes
header: #### Footnotes

While writing the presentation pages there were often minor aspects

* that should not get completely lost,

* but were not necessary for a first, basic understanding.

.N.center[
Such aspects went into the footnotes at the bottom of the presentation pages.
]

In the "live presentation" (running on the beamer in front of you) footnotes are
only shown optionally._[] (by hovering the mouse cursor), the printed version
shows footnotes printed as the other text.

.F[:
The reason is that footnotes should not distract your attention from the main
part of the presentation.
]

---
template: plain
name: code_examples
header: #### Example Code

Concrete C++ Examples are presented as

* [Code Fragments](#code_fragments) within the pages of this presentation,

* and also as complete, [Compilable Source Code](#compilable_code), sorted
  by topic in sub-directories linked to by this presentation.

Please consider the latter as part of the training documents, though it is not
printed to reduce the amount of pages.

.I[
You receive private copies of the example source code on an external medium,
to which you also may add your private annotations in a text-editor..[]
]

That way you can also add your private annotations directly into the source
files.

.F[:
There is usually a printer in the class room you may use to make a printout
if you prefer to add annotations on paper.
]

---
template: plain
name: code_fragments
header: ##### Code Fragments

By there very nature such are limited to a few lines, often omitting details
irrelevant to make the point.._[]

```
#include <cstdlib>
…
void application(char *prog, int argc, const char *args[]) {
    … // whatever the application needs to do
}
…
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    try {
        … // prepare running the actual application code
        application(argv[0], argc-1, argv+1);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS; // everything is OK at this point ...
    }
    catch (...) {
        … // maybe log unxepected error
        return EXIT_FAILURE; // ... but here we have had problem!!
    }
}
```

.F[:
As such fragments are not run through a compiler, occasionally slight careless
mistakes might have slipped in. (Can you spot such a mistake in the code above?)

[Google Chrome Browser]: https://www.google.de/intl/de/chrome/browser/

A printable version is most easily created with the [Google Chrome Browser].

* Just use *Print To File* and maybe

* some post-processing with a PDF-Tool of your choice (e.g. to combine several
  presentation pages on a single printed page)

.N.center[
Currently PDFs may only produced from the normal view, it does not work correctly from
[Presentation Mode](#electronic_annotations).

header: #### Automatic Translation

Modern Browsers now offer the option to automatically translate page content.

.N.center[
Though the quality varies between "usable" and  
"funny to strange", you might want to give it a try.

template: plain
name: private_annotations
header: ### Private Annotations

Of course you may want to extend this document with your own annotations while
taking this course.

#### Annotations to Print Version

The bottom half of all printed pages has been deliberately left empty so that
you can use the space freely for annotations.

Of course, if you download a more recent version of this presentation it may be
less usable without your annotations, so you may want to consider the next page.

.N.center[
If you are happy with paper print-outs you may well stop reading here.._[]
]

The explanations given on the next page are for those who prefer to keep
this document – **including private annotations** – in a fully electronic form
which can be put on a memory stick or stored on a cloud-server.

.F[:
Please understand that **in no way** it is necessary to read and follow the
instructions given on the next page to benefit from this training. These
instructions only deal with how to get an **added value** from an electronic
document form.
]

---
template: plain
name: electronic_annotations
header: #### Annotations to HTML Version

As the core content of the HTML files is written in [markdown format] it is
quite readable by itself and you have the option to handle it with purely
electronic means.

This especially includes **private annotations** you may want to add in the
next days or at any time later, by and by.

1. Save the HTML files of the presentation locally.
2. Add annotations with a text editor of your choice.

When viewing the document in a browser you may include (or exclude) displaying
your annotations by changing to *presenter's mode* (and back).

.N.center[
Simply hit the `p`-key – feel free to try it out right now.._[]
]

Note that you can adjust the font size of annotations by clicking on the small
boxes labeled `+` and `-` at the top of the displayed page.

.F[:
The notes section of this slide is used to explain the document structure.
Future versions of this presentation may or may not use other notes section for
their own purpose too, but it should always be possible to merge an updated
version you have downloaded and your private annotations in the notes sections
with a decent [diff-tool].
]

  [markdown format]: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown
  [diff-tool]:       http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff

???
The content structure of the HTML file is as follows:
````````````````````````````````````````````````````
        (some lines of HTML header)
        (defining page templates etc.)
        <textarea>
        …
        … first slide …
        …
        ---
        … second slide …
        ---
        …
        … (etc.)
        …
        ---
        …
        … last slide …
        …
        &lt;/textarea>
        (some lines of HTML trailer)
````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Lines consisting of **exactly three minus signs** (nothing else!) are page
separators.

Annotations are shown in *Presenter's View* only and must be separated from
the slide content with a line consisting of **exactly three question marks**.
```
        …
        ---
        …
        … presentation slide content …
        …
        ???
        …
        … annotations added by you …
        …
        ---
        …
```

BTW: The easiest way to include small code examples, what might be a typical
use case for private annotations, is to just indent them by four spaces –
surrounding code fragments with lines of three or more back-ticks, a markdown
extension known as [Fenced Code Blocks], is the other option.

    #include <iostream>
    int main() {
        std::cout << "hello, world\n";
    }

[Fenced Code Blocks]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#fenced-code-blocks

As we are at it go: when you have this page loaded in a text editor, with the line
above – **not displayed** when you view this in the browser – and the paragraph
before the code example you have a nice way how to embed links without making
the text flow unreadable or inconvenient to edit.

<!-- The reference in square brackets needs to be unique only within a single slide
     and the line connecting the reference with the external link may be placed
     anywhere in the page … and HTML comments are another way to annotate,
     not even visible in the Presenter's View.
-->

LAST HINT: When loaded in a text editor you will find this final page close to the
end (or can locate it easily by searching for LAST HINT); if you start from here
instead from the top it may be be easier to discover the document structure, as at
the beginning there are first a number of layout template pages not visible in the
browser.
